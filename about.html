      <p>Abraham Afewerki, (Tigrinya: ኣብርሃም ኣፈወርቂ) (30 January 1966 – 7 October 2006) 
      was an Eritrean singer, songwriter, and music producer. Noted for his unique 
      Tigrinya-based compositions and lyrics, he was one of the most recognized 
      figures among Eritrean musicians and celebrities and also the world. 
        Abraham Afewerki was born in 1966 in Asmara. During the Eritrean War of 
        Independence, Abraham and his family fled the fighting and lived as refugees 
        in Sudan. He was interested in music from an early age, taking up the harmonica. 
        Abraham joined the Eritrean People's Liberation Front (EPLF) at the age of 12, 
        as a member of a cultural troupe which toured areas controlled by the EPLF. 
        He began writing his own songs and music regarding the war, performing them 
        from 1979 onwards.

         Abraham moved to Italy, where he learned to play the krar and continued
         to write songs in the theme of Eritrean nationalism. After several years,
         he moved to the United States where he studied for a bachelor's degree with
         honours.
      </p>
      <p> Abraham’s first release, Wegahta (Dawn), was released in 1991. During the
      following 15 years, Abraham released two more albums which further propelled his
      popularity among Eritreans. His songs were popular because his lyrics expressed
      strong and poetic images of Eritrea’s culture. His song "Abzelena Halina" ("Wherever
      We Are") became greatly popular in Eritrea and the world; his socially conscious
      words and evocative lyrics talked of the bravery of the nation.

      In his final release, entitled Semai ("Sky" in Tigrinya), Abraham collaborates with 
      several Eritrean musicians, the result of which was an exquisite sound. Abraham 
      continued to blend his music with jazz, R&B, and Reggae rhythms at the same time 
      maintaining his music’s originality and authenticity. One song from the album, 
      "Semay Deretey Iyu" ("The Sky Is My Limit"), has become one of the popular songs 
      in Eritrea. </p>
